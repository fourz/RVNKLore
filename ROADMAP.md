# RVNKLore Development Roadmap

**Last Updated**: June 25, 2025

This document outlines the planned features and improvements for the RVNKLore plugin.

## Current Status

RVNKLore has established a solid foundation with core functionality in place:

- âœ… Database structure and connection management with unified architecture
- âœ… Query Builder pattern for database dialect abstraction
- âœ… DTO pattern for clean data transfer between layers
- âœ… Basic lore entry creation and management
- âœ… Handler system for different lore types
- âœ… Command framework for player interaction
- âœ… LogManager-based logging pattern (all major classes now use LogManager; Debug fully removed from production code)
- âœ… Content versioning and approval workflow
- âœ… Event-driven architecture for lore generation
- âœ… Integration with VotingPlugin for dynamic rewards

## Logging Refactoring Tasks

All core classes now use the LogManager logger pattern (`logger.debug`, `logger.info`, `logger.error`, etc.). No remaining classes use Debug directly. This milestone is complete.

## Database Architecture Implementation

Following the plan from `docs/plans/rvnklore-database-architecture-refactor-steps.md`, significant progress has been made on the database architecture refactoring:

- âœ… **Core Interface Abstractions**
  - Created `QueryBuilder` interface with implementations for MySQL and SQLite
  - Implemented `SchemaQueryBuilder` for database schema operations
  - Created `ConnectionProvider` interface with database-specific implementations
  - Added `QueryExecutor` interface for standardized query execution

- âœ… **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**
  - Implemented comprehensive DTOs for all major entities
  - Created conversion methods between DTOs and domain objects
  - Added JSON serialization support for complex properties

- âœ… **DatabaseManager as Central Hub**
  - Refactored DatabaseManager to serve as the central data access point
  - Implemented async operation support with CompletableFuture
  - Added connection pooling for MySQL and persistent connection for SQLite
  - Centralized transaction management and error handling

- âœ… **Connection Management Optimization**
  - Implemented connection state tracking to prevent duplicate initialization
  - Added health monitoring and automatic reconnection
  - Improved error recovery and connection validation
  - Added proper resource cleanup on plugin disable

- âœ… **Repository Layer Transformation**
  - Completed conversion of repositories to DTO-based service pattern
  - All repositories now implement asynchronous data access methods
  - Repositories fully delegate connection management to DatabaseManager
  - Transaction support implemented for all multi-step operations
  - Comprehensive error handling with standardized logging patterns

- ðŸŸ¡ **Caching Implementation**
  - Implemented in-memory caching for frequently accessed data
  - Added cache invalidation on data updates
  - Time-based cache expiration implemented
  - Performance metrics for cache hit rates
  - Pending: Advanced two-level caching with repository-specific optimizations

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach

1. Focus on core functionality first (item generation)
2. Ensure solid database design before implementing storage
3. Build comprehensive tests for core item manipulation
4. Create admin tools to simplify management
5. Implement player-facing features last

### Technology Considerations

- Use the Transaction Manager for all database operations
- Leverage asynchronous processing for resource-intensive operations
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Establish clear migration paths between versions

### Resource Allocation

- Primary developer focus on item generation system (Q2)
- Database specialist consultation for storage optimization (Q3)
- UI/UX design resources for admin controls (Q4)
- Community testing phase before each major release

## Success Metrics

- **Item Generation**: Complete generation system with support for all proposed item types
- **Storage**: Zero data loss during item operations, sub-50ms query times
- **VotingPlugin**: Seamless integration with dynamic rewards, positive player feedback
- **Performance**: No measurable TPS impact during normal operation

## Risk Assessment

- **Performance Impact**: As the plugin scales, careful performance optimization is required, particularly for database operations and caching
- **Repository Pattern Complexity**: The DTO/repository pattern increases maintainability but requires diligent adherence to established patterns
- **Async Operation Management**: CompletableFuture-based async operations require careful error handling and context management
- **Plugin Compatibility**: Integration with other plugins may present compatibility challenges, particularly for older plugins
- **Resource Pack Coordination**: Custom model data management requires tight coordination with server resource packs

## Performance Optimization Goals

As the plugin expands, maintaining performance is critical:

- [ ] **Advanced Caching System** *(High Priority)*
  - Implement AbstractCachingService pattern across all managers
  - Two-level caching with memory and disk tiers
  - Configurable cache sizes and expiration policies
  - Cache hit/miss metrics and analytics
  
- [ ] **Asynchronous Operation Optimization** *(High Priority)*
  - Standardize CompletableFuture usage patterns
  - Implement shared thread pool management
  - Batch operation support for database-intensive tasks
  - Main thread offloading for all I/O operations
  
- [ ] **Resource Management** *(Medium Priority)*
  - Memory footprint optimization
  - Object pooling for frequently created instances
  - Resource leak detection and prevention
  - Automatic cleanup for abandoned operations
