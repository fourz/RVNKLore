# RVNKLore CollectionManager

The `CollectionManager` is responsible for managing item collections in the RVNKLore plugin. It organizes items into thematic groups, tracks player progress, and handles collection rewards.

## Recent Edits
- Added enhanced validation for new collection creation.
- Integrated a mechanism to reload collections from the database.
- Improved logging and error handling for collection persistence.
- Updated progress tracking and reward handling for collections.

## Responsibilities
- Define and manage item collections (`ItemCollection`)
- Track player progress and completion
- Handle collection themes, metadata, and rewards
- Integrate with the plugin's logging and item systems
- Support seasonal and event-based collections
- Validate and persist collections to the database
- Provide filtered and paginated access to collections for commands

## Key Methods
- `getCollection(String)`: Retrieve a collection by ID
- `createCollection(String, String, String)`: Register a new collection with validation
- `saveCollection(ItemCollection)`: Persist a collection to the database
- `getPlayerProgress(UUID, String)`: Track player progress
- `grantCollectionReward(UUID, String)`: Grant rewards for completion
- `getAllCollections()`: Retrieve all collections
- `getCollectionsByTheme(String)`: Filter collections by theme
- `reloadCollectionsFromDatabase()`: Refresh in-memory collections from storage
- `shutdown()`: Cleanup

## Example Usage
```java
CollectionManager collectionManager = itemManager.getCollectionManager();
ItemCollection collection = collectionManager.getCollection("winter_wonders");
collectionManager.saveCollection(collection);
```

## Design Notes
- Collections are extensible and support metadata and themes
- Rewards are managed via `CollectionRewards`
- All actions are logged via `LogManager`
- Database integration supports persistence and reload
- Validation ensures unique, well-formed collection IDs
