# RVNKLore CollectionManager

The `CollectionManager` is responsible for managing item collections in the RVNKLore plugin. It organizes items into thematic groups, tracks player progress, and handles collection rewards.

## Recent Edits
- **Refactored to use async, DTO-based repository/service architecture for all collection and progress operations.**
- All collection persistence and queries now use `ItemCollectionDTO` and related DTOs.
- Integrated with the new `DatabaseManager` as the single entry point for all data access.
- All cache and batch logic now operate on DTOs and async flows.
- Enhanced logging and error handling for collection persistence.
- Updated progress tracking and reward handling for collections to be fully asynchronous.

## Responsibilities
- Define and manage item collections (`ItemCollection`)
- Track player progress and completion (async)
- Handle collection themes, metadata, and rewards
- Integrate with the plugin's logging and item systems
- Support seasonal and event-based collections
- Validate and persist collections to the database using DTOs
- Provide filtered and paginated access to collections for commands
- **All database operations are asynchronous and use DTOs for data transfer.**

## Key Methods
- `getCollection(String)`: Retrieve a collection by ID
- `createCollection(String, String, String)`: Register a new collection with validation
- `saveCollection(ItemCollection)`: Persist a collection to the database (async)
- `getPlayerProgress(UUID, String)`: Track player progress (async)
- `grantCollectionReward(UUID, String)`: Grant rewards for completion (async)
- `getAllCollections()`: Retrieve all collections
- `getCollectionsByTheme(String)`: Filter collections by theme
- `reloadCollectionsFromDatabase()`: Refresh in-memory collections from storage (async)
- `shutdown()`: Cleanup

## Example Usage
```java
CollectionManager collectionManager = itemManager.getCollectionManager();
CompletableFuture<ItemCollection> collectionFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> collectionManager.getCollection("winter_wonders"));
collectionFuture.thenAccept(collection -> {
    collectionManager.saveCollection(collection);
});
// Async progress check
collectionManager.getPlayerProgress(player.getUniqueId(), "winter_wonders").thenAccept(progress -> {
    // Handle progress value
});
```

## Design Notes
- Collections are extensible and support metadata and themes
- Rewards are managed via `CollectionRewards` (integration in progress)
- All actions are logged via `LogManager`
- Database integration supports async persistence and reload
- Validation ensures unique, well-formed collection IDs
- **All legacy direct SQL/config/database connection usage has been removed from CollectionManager. All persistence is now handled via async repository/service methods and DTOs.**
